{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Waterbury and Company Woolen Mill", "icon": "Ruins", "description": "Just past the Lower Falls bridge, hikers will find the ruins of the Waterbury and Company woolen mill (1870–1878). Since the early settling of Rensselaerville, many mills have been built along Ten-Mile Creek, the water body that feeds the Rensselaerville Falls. In fact, the early mills of Rensselaerville were one of the main factors that drew settlers to the area. Mills harnessing the power of the Rensselaerville Falls existed as early as 1794. The first mill located here may have been a gristmill (for grinding grain). Later, a fulling mill was built to process local wool.</p><p>In 1860, Henry Waterbury rebuilt the fulling mill and installed new wool-processing machinery. During the 1800s, woolen felts had become an integral part of paper production—the felt was used to make long, continuous belts that carried paper through machines as excess moisture was pressed out. Waterbury saw an opportunity to make papermakers' felt at his mill. He partnered with Francis Conkling Huyck Sr. in 1870, and their mill became the fourth in the United States to manufacture these felts. They faced many challenges such as labor shortages, product transportation problems, an insufficient supply of raw materials, and an unreliable source of waterpower. In 1878, Waterbury and Huyck agreed to dissolve their partnership effective in 1880 and in that year went their separate ways; the machinery was removed and the mill demolished. Huyck started his own felt-making business in Kenwood, near Albany. When that mill was destroyed by fire in 1894, he built a new one in Rensselaer and ultimately brought his three sons—Edmund, John, and Francis Jr.—into the new firm of F.C. Huyck & Sons, which continued to be a leading manufacturer of papermakers' felts, wool jackets, and bed blankets until the early 1980s.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Caprio, Katie Barker. “The Mill that Huyck Built.” Icsnews.wordpress.com.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Lincoln Pond Cottage", "icon": "Building", "description": "<p>The Huyck Preserve’s Lincoln Pond Cottage and Lincoln Pond, where it sits, are likely named for Joseph Lincoln, though this land was first leased in 1792 by Thomas Watson (see Wheeler Watson Cemetery information). Records show the Lincolns settled in the area before 1786. The cottage was part of a working farm complete with barns and a sawmill. The cottage was built in the 1790’s. From the 1800s through the 1860s, the Lincolns and John and Harvey Bouton ran a sawmill just to the east of Lincoln Pond Cottage, harnessing the power of the original spillway off the pond to process boards and beams for new homes and businesses. Two such beams measuring 24-inches wide and 12-inches high were used to build the foundation of Lincoln Pond Cottage. The land in the area transitioned from deep virgin forest dominated by Eastern hemlock and hardwoods like sugar maple, American beech, and yellow birch to farm fields. The early dam for the sawmill spillway was built in 1800. Myron Bryant was the last Lincoln Pond miller after returning from the California gold rush around 1849. The mill closed a few years before World War I, and the building collapsed shortly after. In 1913 the 130-acre farm including the cottage, barns, pond and sawmill were bought by Edmund Niles Huyck, an avid fly fisherman, for enjoyment as a fishing retreat. After Edmund died in 1930, the Lincoln Pond Farm became a key part of the Huyck Preserve, created by Jessie Van Antwerp Huyck in 1931.</p> <p>One barn associated with the Lincoln homestead became the Huyck Preserve’s first research laboratory when the Preserve’s biological field station was established in 1938 and was the site of important early research by naturalists and ecologists including Donald Griffin who began his studies on bats at the Preserve in 1939 and coined the term “echolocation” in 1944. In 1996 the barn near Lincoln Pond was transformed into the research center that you see today, with the old hand-hewn beams of the barn still visible in the basement.</p><p>Learn more about the history of this parcel and how it was enjoyed by the extended Huyck family by visiting the blog created by Laura Carter, the great, great niece of Edmund and Jessie Huyck.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Carter, Laura, personal communication, 2022.\n</p><p>Carter, Laura. \"The Many Lives of Lincoln Pond Cottage.\" Iscnews.wordpress.com.

The Wheeler\nWatson cemetery was used as a burial ground during the 1800s by the Watsons and their\nneighbors, most of whom were related to the Lincoln or Bouton families. Wheeler Watson\nmoved with five other of his at least eight siblings from Rhode Island to Rensselaerville in the\nlate 1790s. In 1799, Wheeler and his younger brother Thomas together acquired a lease on the\nland that now contains the cemetery and Lincoln Pond (lot 286). The Lincoln family had lived in\nthe area even before the Watsons, settling here before 1786. In 1830, Samuel Watson, Thomas\nWatson’s son, sold the lease of his land to the Boutons. Included in the record of the sale was a\nstatement excluding about a quarter acre of land “now laid out and appropriated as a burying\nground, and which is to be kept and preserved for ever.”</p><p>Of the 33 people thought to be buried in the cemetery, 28 have been identified.
