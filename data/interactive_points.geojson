There is evidence a mill existed at this site as early as 1794. It may have been a gristmill (for grinding grain) and later a fulling mill which processed wool from local farmers and returned it to them as finished fabric. The mill was situated on this site to harness the power of the Rensselaerville Falls. In 1860, Henry Waterbury rebuilt the site and installed new wool-processing machinery.</p><p>During the 1800s, woolen felts had become an integral part of paper production&mdash;the felt was used to make long continuous belts that picked up paper and carried it through machines as excess moisture was pressed out.</p><p>Waterbury saw an opportunity to make papermakers' felt at his mill. He partnered with Francis Conkling Huyck Sr. in 1870, and their mill became the fourth in the United States to manufacture these felts. Unfortunately, they faced many challenges such as labor shortages, product transportation problems, an insufficient supply of raw materials, and an unreliable source of waterpower. In 1879, Waterbury and Huyck dissolved their partnership and went their separate ways; the machinery was removed and the mill demolished. Huyck started his own felt-making business in Kenwood, near Albany. When that mill was destroyed by fire in 1894, he built a new one in Rensselaer and brought his three sons&mdash;Edmund, John, and Francis Jr.&mdash;into the new firm of F.C. Huyck &amp;amp; Sons, which continued to be a leading manufacturer of papermakers' felts, wool jackets, and bed blankets until the early 1980s.</p><p>This project was supported with funding from the New York State Conservation Partnership Program (NYSCPP) and New York's Environmental Protection Fund.

The early dam for that spillway was built in 1800. Myron Bryant was the last Lincoln Pond miller after returning from the California gold rush around 1849. The mill closed a few years before World War I, and the building collapsed shortly after. In 1912 the land around the pond was bought by Edmund Niles Huyck.</p><p>One barn associated with the Lincoln homestead became the Huyck Preserve&rsquo;s first research laboratory and was the site of important early research by naturalists and ecologists. Another barn, located across the street in the area of the larger parking lot, was the site of the discovery of bat echolocation by Donald Griffin, Ph.D. in 1939.

Wheeler Watson moved with five others of his at least eight siblings from Rhode Island to Rensselaerville in the late 1790s. In 1799, Wheeler and his younger brother Thomas together acquired a lease on the land that now contains the cemetery and Lincoln Pond (lot 286).
